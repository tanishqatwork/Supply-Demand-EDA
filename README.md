# Supply-Demand-EDA
# City Supply and Demand Insights

The goal of this project is to analyze urban supply and demand patterns to uncover trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improved resource allocation and planning.

## Overview

In rapidly growing urban environments, balancing supply and demand is crucial for sustainable city planning. This project leverages data provided by StrataScratch to:
- **Analyze demand trends** across different urban areas.
- **Investigate supply adequacy** in meeting demand.
- **Identify anomalies and patterns** that could inform city planning and resource allocation.

Our analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualizations to deliver actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners.

## Project Description

The analysis in this project includes:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data normalization, and merging relevant data sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generating summary statistics, visual trends over time, and city-level comparisons.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables to better capture supply/demand dynamics.
- **Modeling and Predictions:** Using regression and clustering techniques to forecast demand and segment cities based on supply performance.
- **Visualization:** Presenting findings through interactive charts and graphs that highlight key patterns and potential issues.
